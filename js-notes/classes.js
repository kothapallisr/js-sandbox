/**
 * The fact that both the inherited and overridden methods can have the 
 * same name and co-exist is called polymorphism.

   Inheritance is a powerful tool for organizing data/behavior in 
   separate logical units (classes), but allowing the child class 
   to cooperate with the parent by accessing/using its behavior and data.
